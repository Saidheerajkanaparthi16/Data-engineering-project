End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline for Customer Demographics and Sales Analytics using Azure Cloud
# Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive data engineering pipeline on Azure designed to address the business needs of understanding customer demographics, specifically focusing on gender distribution and its influence on product purchases. The pipeline extracts data from an on-premises SQL database, processes it using Azure Databricks, and loads it into Azure Synapse Analytics for reporting and analysis. The final data is visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard, providing stakeholders with valuable insights into sales by gender and product category.
